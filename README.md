# Laurits Fredsgaard Larsen

Hi, I'm Laurits. Currently, I'm diving deep into **Uncertainty Quantification for Graph Neural Networks** as a PhD student at DTU Compute, Technical University of Denmark. My research revolves around Bayesian Neural Networks and their applications in Molecular Discovery.

Previously, I've worked extensively in **Molecular Biomedicine**, and I'm keen on leveraging this background to bridge the gap between biomedicine and advanced computation.

Got a question or an opportunity in mind? I'm always open for a chat.
