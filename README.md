**Hi there, I'm Laurits** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student at DTU Compute, Technical University of Denmark, focusing on Uncertainty Quantification for Graph Neural Networks.

I am currently a visiting researcher at the National Institute of Informatics (NII) in Tokyo (Oct 2025 - Mar 2026), collaborating with [Prof. Mahito Sugiyama](https://mahito.nii.ac.jp/) to explore the geometric properties of deep ensembles.

My research revolves around Bayesian Neural Networks and their applications in Molecular Discovery. Previously, I've worked extensively in Molecular Biomedicine, and I'm keen on leveraging this background to bridge the gap between life sciences and advanced computation.

You can find more details about my work and publications on my personal website: [laurits.me](https://laurits.me/).

Feel free to reach out if you have a question or an opportunity in mind. I'm always open for a chat.
