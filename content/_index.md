## About me

I'm a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark, specifically within the [Cognitive Systems](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/sections/cogsys) section. My research focuses on the development of [Bayesian neural networks for molecular discovery](https://datascience.novonordiskfonden.dk/projects/bayesian-neural-networks-for-molecular-discovery/).

I started my PhD, titled "Uncertainty Quantification for Graph Neural Networks", in September 2023, and I'm supervised by [Mikkel N. Schmidt](http://www.mikkelschmidt.dk/) (main supervisor) and [Michael Riis Andersen](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/michael-riis-andersen) (co-supervisor).

### Research interests

My research focuses on **uncertainty quantification for graph neural networks (GNNs)** applied to molecular discovery. I aim to develop reliable machine learning models that can accelerate the development of new medicines. I am broadly interested in:

* **Efficient Deep Ensembles:** Deep ensembles are highly effective for uncertainty quantification, but their computational cost can be prohibitive. How can we develop more efficient ensemble methods?
* **Scalable and Performant Bayesian Neural Networks:** Bayesian neural networks offer a principled approach to uncertainty estimation, but scaling them to large datasets and complex models remains a challenge. How can we improve their scalability and performance?
* **Uncertainty Quantification in Graph Neural Networks:** GNNs excel at capturing complex relationships, but how can we effectively quantify their uncertainty? Can we leverage their unique architectural properties to develop novel uncertainty estimation techniques?
* **Learning with Limited Labeled Data:**  Labeled molecule data is often scarce. How can we leverage unlabeled data, related modalities (e.g., omics, images, text), and prior knowledge to improve model performance?
* **Integrating Machine Learning with Experimentation:** How can we effectively integrate machine learning models into the experimental workflow ("lab-in-a-loop") to accelerate the discovery process?

### Background

I have a dual background in life science and computer science, holding degrees in both *Molecular Biomedicine* and *Machine Learning & Data Science* from the University of Copenhagen.

My experimental research focused on virology and vaccine design. I studied the Hepatitis C Virus at [Osaka University's RIMD](https://www.biken.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/) under [Yoshiharu Matsuura](https://www.biken.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/researchers/detail/6) (2017) and for my bachelor's project at Hvidovre Hospital with [Jens Bukh](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=ebaj2BQAAAAJ) (2018). Subsequently, my master's thesis (2018-2020) in [Adam Sander's lab](https://cmp.ku.dk/research/vlpvac-team/) centered on cVLP-based vaccines, where I supported the preclinical development of the ABNCoV2 COVID-19 vaccine, which has since proven highly successful in clinical trials.

My transition towards computational work includes my role as a student bioinformatician at [LEO Pharma](https://www.leo-pharma.com/), where I built data analysis pipelines for omics data. For my final project in Machine Learning (2022-2023), I had the opportunity to work with [Wouter Boomsma](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=EwqU_jsAAAAJ) on deep learning models for protein sequences and structures.
