## About me

I'm a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark, specifically within the [Cognitive Systems](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/sections/cogsys) section. My research focuses on the development of [Bayesian neural networks for molecular discovery](https://datascience.novonordiskfonden.dk/projects/bayesian-neural-networks-for-molecular-discovery/).

I started my PhD, titled "Uncertainty Quantification for Graph Neural Networks", in September 2023, and I'm supervised by [Mikkel N. Schmidt](http://www.mikkelschmidt.dk/) (main supervisor) and [Michael Riis Andersen](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/michael-riis-andersen) (co-supervisor).

### Research interests

My research focuses on **uncertainty quantification for graph neural networks (GNNs)** applied to molecular discovery. I aim to develop reliable machine learning models that can accelerate the development of new medicines. I am broadly interested in:

* **Efficient Deep Ensembles:** Deep ensembles are highly effective for uncertainty quantification, but their computational cost can be prohibitive. How can we develop more efficient ensemble methods?
* **Scalable and Performant Bayesian Neural Networks:** Bayesian neural networks offer a principled approach to uncertainty estimation, but scaling them to large datasets and complex models remains a challenge. How can we improve their scalability and performance?
* **Uncertainty Quantification in Graph Neural Networks:** GNNs excel at capturing complex relationships, but how can we effectively quantify their uncertainty? Can we leverage their unique architectural properties to develop novel uncertainty estimation techniques?
* **Learning with Limited Labeled Data:**  Labeled molecule data is often scarce. How can we leverage unlabeled data, related modalities (e.g., omics, images, text), and prior knowledge to improve model performance?
* **Integrating Machine Learning with Experimentation:** How can we effectively integrate machine learning models into the experimental workflow ("lab-in-a-loop") to accelerate the discovery process?

### Background

While I'm now focused on machine learning, I have a diverse background spanning both hands-on experimental work and computational analysis. I hold degrees in both *Molecular Biomedicine* and *Machine Learning and Data Science* from the University of Copenhagen. I've gained experience in molecular biology, working with viruses, vaccines, and protein engineering.

Complementing my experimental skills, I worked as a bioinformatician at [LEO Pharma](https://www.leo-pharma.com/) during my studies, where I developed data analysis pipelines and built scalable systems for biological datasets, including experience with omics data and public APIs.
