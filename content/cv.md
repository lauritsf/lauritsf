## About Me
I currently study Machine Learning and Data Science at University of Copenhagen. 💻

From my MSc in Molecular Biomedicine, I have lots of practical experience working with protiens, cells and viruses. 👨🏻‍🔬

## Research Interest
I am interested in all things Machine Learning in Life Science,
but I am particularly keen on developing models to support protein research.
