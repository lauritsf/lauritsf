Prof. Mikkel N. Schmidt
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the analysis of molecular data and prediction of molecular properties, showcasing unparalleled predictive capabilities. However, one of the critical challenges with neural networks lies in their inability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates. This limitation becomes a significant hurdle in the domain of drug and material development, where uncertainty quantification is not just a measure of model confidence but a pivotal tool for guiding exploratory searches in vast chemical spaces.</description></item></channel></rss>
